Welcome to our project page! If you would like to run our embedding/ clustering code yourself please follow the instructions below:

1. Click the "Preprocessed Recordings" link below, which will open our .zip file in your "Shared with Me" folder in your Google Drive.
2. Click on the three dots on your file's tab to open file options. From there, select "Add a shortcut" option for the folder, and select "My Drive". You should now be able to go to "My Drive" and see a shortcut to our data file there. This way, you will be able to access our data files via your Google Colab without having to redownload it.
3. After opening the notebook of your choice in Google Colab and mounting your drive, you will now be able to run our code.
